# HackAndBash
Hack and Bash is a text based adventure which uses the Bourne-again shell (Bash) and the GNU core utils as the platform for all gameplay mechanics.

The goal of Hack and Bash is to teach people how to use Bash and GNU core utils (GCU) while also providing an enjoyable gaming experience. It is my hope that new Bash/GCU users and experienced Bash/GCU users will both be able to enjoy this game.
